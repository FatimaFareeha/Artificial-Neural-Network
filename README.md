# Artificial-Neural-Network
An Artificial Neural Network or ANN is an information processing paradigm that is inspired by the way the biological nervous system, such as the brain, processes information. It is composed of large number of highly interconnected processing elements (neurons) working in unison to solve a specific problem.

A neural network is a framework of many different algorithms which work together and process complex data inputs. It is an excellent tool for finding patterns which are far too complex or numerous for a human programmer to extract and teach the machine to recognize.

The human brain is composed of 86 billion nerve cells called neurons. They are connected to other thousand cells by Axons. Stimuli from external environment or inputs from sensory organs are accepted by dendrites. These inputs create electric impulses, which quickly travel through the neural network. A neuron can then send the message to other neuron to handle the issue or does not send it forward. Similarly, taking inspiration from the biological precursor, ANNs are composed of multiple nodes, which imitate biological neurons of human brain. The neurons are connected by links and they interact with each other. The nodes can take input data and perform simple operations on the data. The result of these operations is passed to other neurons. The output at each node is called its activation or node value.

Originally, ANNs were used to solve problems the same way a human brain would. But over time, attention shifted and they were used to perform specific tasks. Artificial Neural Networks are being used to perform various tasks such as: computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games, medical diagnosis, and even in activities that have traditionally been considered as reserved to humans, like painting.

Any Artificial Neural Network, irrespective of the style and logic of implementation, has a few basic characteristics:\
     • An Artificial Neural Network consists of large number of  “neuron” like processing elements.\
     • All these processing elements have a large number of weighted connections between them.\
     • The connections between the elements provide a distributed representation of data.\
     • A Learning Process is implemented to acquire knowledge.
  
ANNs have a number of advantages, some of which are listed below:\
      • ANN’s have the ability to learn and model non-linear and complex relationships.\
      • It does not impose any restrictions on the input variables.\
      • It is very good at handling highly volatile data which makes it a very useful tool in financial time series forecasting.
    
ANNs are powerful models that have a wide range of far-reaching applications across many different fields in medicine, security, banking/finance as well as government, agriculture and defense, all owing to its design model. Some applications are as follows:\
      • Image processing.\
      • Language processing.\
      • Speech recognition.\
      • Character recognition.\
      • Segmentation of image.\
      • Anomaly detection.\
      • Forecasting.
